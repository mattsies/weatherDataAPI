# Current Weather Forecast

This script is a great introduction to using python to call APIs and push data to slack.


This script is organized into two parts:
1. *weathermap.org API request* pulls current weather data for a city, parses into a json file and stores specific fields into a dictionary called weatherData.
2. *slack API post* weatherData dictionary is stored as a text string and pushed to slack using incoming API webhook.
